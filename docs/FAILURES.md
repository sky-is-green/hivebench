# TBR Failure Register

> **Companion:** [`docs/WHITEPAPER.md`](WHITEPAPER.md) — the source of truth.
> This register is the grounding document: every failed or falsified route,
> recorded so it can be re-assessed objectively later.

**Created:** 2026-09-20 (initial seeding from Rounds 1–13).
**Policy:** append-only. New entries get a new `F<n>` and a timestamp; existing
entries are never rewritten — corrections are appended as `[rev <date>]` notes.

## Categories

- **(a) falsified hypotheses** — scientific claims that failed a controlled test.
- **(b) implementation dead-ends** — engineering routes that could not work as built.
- **(c) resolved incidents** — post-mortems of crashes/blocks, with the mitigation.
- **(d) open bugs/risks** — known defects or hazards still live.

## Entry schema

## F1 — Public PTQ collapses off-calibration

- **Category:** (a) falsified hypothesis (scientific).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** A public PTQ stack (GPTQ + salient + QuIP rotation) can
  reach Bonsai-2-class quality at ~2 bpw, and the published **2.1×** is the
  attainable off-calibration bar.
- **Method:** Ported ThakiCloud's `quip.py` verbatim into
  `experiments/ternary/reference.py` (dense QR rotation, their upper-Cholesky
  `Hinv`, per-row absmean, block 128); binary and ternary arms on
  `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B`; fixed-passage metric vs held-out windows with real
  `32×2048` calibration Hessians.
- **Outcome:** Fixed-passage binary `rotate=in, damp=0.3` reproduces the
  published number exactly: **2.027 → 4.268 = 2.106×**. With real calibration
  and *held-out* evaluation the same configurations collapse: binary **1178×**,
  ternary `in/d0.1` **9184×**, `both/d0.1` **34877×** (fp32 held-out PPL 39.7).
  Our own T10 canary was **3514×** held-out. The public stack is the same order
  of broken (1.2e3–3.5e4×).
- **Verdict:** Falsified. The 2.1× exists only when calibration and evaluation
  are the same passage.
- **Evidence:** commit `ea089e2`; `artifacts/ternary/reference/*.json`;
  `docs/RUN-CANARY.md`; HIVE-PLAN Round 6.
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** PTQ tuning as a route to 27B parity; the published 2.1×
  as an off-calibration quality bar.
- **Cost to revisit:** low ($0, ~100 s per config) — but only meaningful if a
  genuinely new algorithm appears.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F2 — GPTQ/Hessian variants move codes away from Prism's

- **Category:** (a) falsified hypothesis (scientific).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Prism's 8% trit residual (vs rotate+absmean RTN) is an
  error-compensation trick recoverable with GPTQ/OBQ in the correct basis.
- **Method:** Loaded embedding + layers 0–3 of the 27B only (55 tensors, no
  55 GB residency); captured real Shakespeare Hessians; layout-adjusted and
  rotated each weight per T30; swept GPTQ damping, act-order, `RᵀHR` vs raw
  `H`, and group scale search.
- **Outcome:** Agreement with Prism's trits — **RTN absmean 0.9145**;
  GPTQ `d0.01` **0.8086**, `d0.1` **0.8395**, `d0.3` **0.8497**; act-order
  **0.8065**; `RᵀHR` **0.8086**; raw `H` **0.7991**; group scale-search
  diagonal **0.8625**, block **0.8506**. Monotone in damping: suppressing
  compensation converges back to RTN. Every error-compensated assignment moves
  codes *away* from theirs.
- **Verdict:** Falsified. The quantizer reverse-engineering track is closed.
- **Evidence:** `artifacts/ternary/gate3/prefix27/sweep-layer0.json`;
  `RESEARCH/gate3-qat-verdict.md`; HIVE-PLAN Round 12. (T32 was diagnostics-only;
  no source commit.)
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** GPTQ/OBQ as the missing mechanism; a GPTQ rental for
  parity.
- **Cost to revisit:** low locally (prefix trick); no rental justified.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F3 — Stochastic Calibration Resonance falsified

- **Category:** (a) falsified hypothesis (scientific).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Calibration noise/dithering (stochastic rounding) can
  explain Prism's assignment.
- **Method:** 1.7B GPTQ g128, damp 0.1, clean vs 5%-random-token-noise Hessians,
  compared against Prism's released 1.7B `PQ2_0` trits (byte-exact decode).
- **Outcome:** RTN 0.61196; GPTQ clean 0.61771; GPTQ noise5 **0.61774**;
  noise moved 4.28% of codes; agreement change **+0.003 pp**. No effect.
  Side finding: the `Q2_0_g64` (type 42) decoder in `oracle.py` decodes garbage
  (see F13); T7's 0.612 came from the F16 dequant, not this decoder.
- **Verdict:** Falsified.
- **Evidence:** `artifacts/ternary/gate3/scr-report.json`;
  `RESEARCH/gate3-qat-verdict.md`; HIVE-PLAN Round 12.
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** calibration noise, dithering and stochastic rounding as
  the source of the residual.
- **Cost to revisit:** low ($0).
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F4 — No-rental rotate+absmean RTN parity is dead

- **Category:** (a) falsified hypothesis (scientific).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** The no-rental shortcut — rotate the public base into
  Prism's basis and pack absmean RTN — reproduces Prism's quality (their 1.44×).
- **Method:** Copied Prism's GGUF and rewrote **all 402** `PQ2_0` payloads in
  place with rotate+absmean RTN of the pinned public base (converter layouts per
  T30; embeddings input-rotated). Metadata, tokenizer, F32/BF16 exemptions and
  the tensor table stayed byte-identical; repack byte-exact; 402/402 post-patch
  SHA-256 verified. Eval: fork `llama-perplexity`, `-ngl 99 -c 512 --chunks 8`,
  tinyshakespeare, ROCm1, one process.
- **Outcome:** Prism `PQ2_0` **18.5851 ± 1.209**; ours (402 RTN payloads, same
  file) **23,606.19 ± 1231.6** = **1,270×**. Smoke with only layers 0+3 patched
  (2 chunks): 53.89 vs 20.41 = 2.6× from 13/402 tensors — the GDN recurrence
  amplifies small weight perturbations.
- **Verdict:** Falsified. 92% trit agreement is not a quality proxy; the missing
  8% carries the entire gap.
- **Evidence:** commit `5eac0c0` (T31); `artifacts/ternary/gate2/eval-report.json`;
  `artifacts/ternary/gate2/rtn-absmean.gguf`; `RESEARCH/gate2-rtn-quality.md`;
  HIVE-PLAN Round 11.
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** the no-rental rotate+RTN shortcut for parity; trit
  agreement as a standalone quality metric.
- **Cost to revisit:** low locally, but the direction is settled.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F5 — The last ~8% was localized to end-to-end QAT and deliberately not funded

- **Category:** (a)/(b) mixed — partial scientific result, **closed by scope
  decision** (not a methodological dead-end).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Local QAT/KD (STE ternary training + KD) can close the
  quality gap and reach Prism's acceptance rate (≥97% retention, stretch 98.2%
  = Bonsai-2 parity) without a rental.
- **Method:** T28 `experiments/ternary/recover.py` — 196 attention/MLP linears
  wrapped as exact ternary (g128, half-away) with straight-through gradients;
  bf16 master weights; KD vs the frozen fp32 teacher; Adafactor + gradient
  checkpointing; 301k-token tinyshakespeare corpus. It ran *after* the
  elimination programme (Gates 1–3; F1–F4, F6, F7) had localized the gap.
- **Outcome:** Held-out PPL — run1 (1500 steps) 1.673×; run2 (5000 steps)
  student 42.988 vs teacher 38.966 = **1.103×** (90.6% retention); run3 (7000
  steps) 1.129× with held-out worsening while train loss fell (overfit).
  1.103× clears the 1.44× Prism bar but is **short of the ≥97% mission
  retention target** (stretch 98.2%). Corpus-limited at ~5k steps.
- **Why this is the last 8% (elimination chain):** Gate 2 (F4) showed the ~8%
  trit residual carries the entire quality gap; Gate 3 (F2, F3) showed that
  residual is *weight movement during training*, not any quantizer/calibration
  trick; and local per-layer KD cannot control global compounding (F6, F7).
  With every non-training route eliminated, end-to-end QAT/KD is the only
  remaining route to Prism's exact acceptance. The gap is therefore *localized*,
  not mysterious.
- **Verdict:** **Deliberate stop, not a dead-end.** The fix is known and priced;
  the programme chose not to fund a 27B end-to-end proof-run because Track B
  already delivers the capability from Prism's public weights, and the
  proof-run has real cost and uncertain yield (the 1.7B QAT run was itself
  short of target).
- **Decision (2026-09-20, programme owner):** do not run the 27B end-to-end QAT
  proof. Rationale: (i) the mission non-goal is to reproduce the recipe — the
  target is the result; (ii) that result is public; (iii) the remaining
  confidence is a localization/inference, not a demonstrated replication.
- **Evidence:** commit `64ff7bc` (T28);
  `artifacts/ternary/recover/run1/recover-report-s5000.json` and
  `recover-report.json`; bar 1.44× from commit `8cd8038` (T7) / HIVE-PLAN
  Round 7; HIVE-PLAN Round 9.
- **Status:** closed by decision (deferred, not eliminated).
- **What it rules out:** local QAT/KD at 1.7B on a 301k-token corpus as a
  *complete* quality path. It does **not** rule out 27B end-to-end QAT.
- **Cost to revisit:** medium — a real 27B KD corpus plus either a 1×48–80 GB
  rental for full-master QAT or a substantially larger local LoRA/block-wise
  pilot, plus iteration.
- **Worth re-assessing?** Only if *capability ownership* (rather than using
  Prism's public weights) becomes a requirement.
- **[rev 2026-09-20] Seed discrepancy:** the handoff seeded F5 as
  "quality gate failed". HIVE-PLAN Round 9 and the T28 task row record the gate
  as **PASSED** (1.103× < 1.44× bar). The defensible failure is at the *mission*
  level (90.6% < 97%), not the T28 gate. This entry records the verified
  reading; see "Seeded-entry verification notes" below.
- **[rev 2026-09-20b] Reframed per programme-owner clarification:** F5 was
  treated as a failure against the *mission acceptance rate* — we expected to
  match Prism's retention and set out to find the last 8% — not against the T28
  gate. The 8% trit residual (Gates 1–3) is where that quality lies, and
  end-to-end QAT is the only route to it. The route was priced and consciously
  skipped, because Prism's result is public and Track B already ships it. This
  is a budget/scope decision, not an inability to proceed.

## F6 — Student-stream block-wise KD dead-end

- **Category:** (b) implementation dead-end (engineering).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Training each transformer block against the frozen
  block's own output (student stream) can replace end-to-end QAT.
- **Method:** `artifacts/ternary/pilot/scripts/blockwise_kd.py`; 64 layers
  sequentially, 16 windows × 512 tokens, 300 STE steps/layer; then packed and
  evaluated under the Gate-2 protocol.
- **Outcome:** Per-layer relative error improved (e.g. layer 0 0.4225 → 0.1084),
  but the assembled model evaluated at **PPL 1,252,835 (1.25 M)** — worse than
  plain RTN. Error compounds across blocks.
- **Verdict:** Dead-end as a standalone route.
- **Evidence:** `artifacts/ternary/pilot/blockwise/blockwise-report.json`,
  `artifacts/ternary/pilot/blockwise/eval-bw.log`;
  `artifacts/ternary/CLEANUP.md`; HIVE-PLAN Round 13.
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** per-layer student-stream training as a substitute for
  end-to-end training.
- **Cost to revisit:** low locally, but only as a component of end-to-end QAT.
- **Worth re-assessing?** Only inside an end-to-end QAT loop.

## F7 — Teacher-forced block-wise KD dead-end

- **Category:** (b) implementation dead-end (engineering).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Using the fp32 teacher's per-layer outputs as targets
  (teacher forcing) controls compounding.
- **Method:** Same sequential block trainer with teacher-forced targets
  (`artifacts/ternary/pilot/scripts/blockwise_kd.py`, `_tf` variant); 64 layers,
  16×512 windows, 300 steps/layer.
- **Outcome:** Assembled PPL **1,055,018 (1.06 M)** — better than the
  student-stream variant (F6) but still far worse than RTN. Local per-layer KD
  cannot control global compounding.
- **Verdict:** Dead-end. Only end-to-end QAT can.
- **Evidence:** `artifacts/ternary/pilot/blockwise_tf/blockwise-tf-report.json`,
  `artifacts/ternary/pilot/blockwise_tf/eval-bw.log`; HIVE-PLAN Round 13.
- **Status:** closed.
- **What it rules out:** per-layer teacher-forced KD as a local substitute for
  end-to-end QAT.
- **Cost to revisit:** low locally; not recommended.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F8 — Entropy/excess-loss data selection lost to random

- **Category:** (a)/(b) mixed.
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Selecting KD windows by model surprisal / learning
  progress (top-20% by teacher CE and RTN-student CE) beats random sampling.
- **Method:** Wikitext-103 pool scored by teacher CE and RTN-student CE
  (`artifacts/ternary/pilot/`); top-20% (`run-selected`) vs random
  (`run-random`) KD arms, identical budget; held-out eval.
- **Outcome:** Selected **student PPL 172.28** vs random **115.91** (teacher
  22.83). The selected arm lost.
- **Verdict:** Falsified for this pilot. (Score report: selected excess mean
  14.22 vs random 12.50 — the ranking did not isolate better training windows.)
- **Evidence:** `artifacts/ternary/pilot/eval-selected.json`,
  `artifacts/ternary/pilot/eval-random.json`,
  `artifacts/ternary/pilot/score-report.json`; HIVE-PLAN Round 13.
- **Status:** closed (pilot scale).
- **What it rules out:** this scoring function, at this pool/budget, as a
  data-selection win.
- **Cost to revisit:** low locally — a larger pool, multiple seeds, or a
  different selection metric could change the result.
- **Worth re-assessing?** Yes, if a real 27B KD corpus is built.

## F9 — 27B full-model CPU offload swap-thrashes

- **Category:** (b)/(c) implementation dead-end / incident.
- **Claim/hypothesis:** The 55.6 GB 27B base can be loaded with CPU offload for
  full-model Hessian capture.
- **Method:** Attempted full-model load/offload for 27B Hessians on a 2×20 GB
  card / 30 GiB host.
- **Outcome:** Swap-thrash; the job was killed and replaced by the **prefix
  trick** (load embedding + first N layers only), which avoids 55 GB residency
  and made the Gate-3 Hessians possible.
- **Verdict:** Full-model offload is not viable on this box.
- **Evidence:** HIVE-PLAN Rounds 11–12; `HANDOFF-TBR.md` §6;
  `artifacts/ternary/base27/` (52 GiB on disk); `artifacts/ternary/CLEANUP.md`.
- **Status:** resolved (workaround adopted).
- **What it rules out:** full 27B residency/offload for local diagnostics.
- **Cost to revisit:** n/a unless a 1×48–80 GB machine is rented.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F10 — `-ngl 99` allocation failure on one 20 GB card

- **Category:** (c) resolved incident (post-mortem).
- **Claim/hypothesis:** The 27B `PQ2_0` (7.2 GB) fits one 20 GB card at
  `-ngl 99` with a large context.
- **Method:** Direct `llama-server` launch with `-ngl 99` and default context.
- **Outcome:** `alloc_tensor_range: failed to allocate ROCm0 buffer of size
  27233914880` → `llama_model_load: error loading model: unable to allocate
  ROCm0 buffer`. The requested buffer (~25.4 GB) exceeds the 20 GB card.
- **Verdict:** Resolved by unsloth-style auto-fit `ngl` (`fit_gpu_layers`,
  ~10% VRAM headroom minus the f16 KV cache) plus an OOM pre-flight guard.
- **Evidence:** `logs/llama_server_8090.log:2912–2913`; commit `a52aace`
  (`harness/models.py`, `fit_gpu_layers` at line 379); commit `abe76d3`
  (OOM guard); HIVE-PLAN hardening series.
- **Status:** resolved.
- **What it rules out:** blind `-ngl 99` on a single card; naive context sizing.
- **Cost to revisit:** none.
- **Worth re-assessing?** No.

## F11 — Sibling `splinter-memory` drift blocks live harness import

- **Category:** (c)/(d) resolved incident + open durable fix.
- **Claim/hypothesis:** hivebench's live harness can import the sibling
  `splinter-memory` package against current `main`.
- **Method:** Repo-wide collection against the sibling checkout.
- **Outcome:** Collection fails: `cortex.config.SplinterConfig` / `cortex.splinter`
  no longer exist after the sibling's `splinter` → `splinter` reorganisation.
  **Resolved operationally** by the F6 pin
  (`SPLINTER_HOME=../worktrees/splinter-memory/hivebench-SPLINTER-PIN`,
  `PYTHONPATH=$PIN/splinter`), a detached worktree at the pre-rename P2-DILUTION
  tip `bc332c1` (unit 561 passed, integration 50 passed + 3 skipped).
- **Verdict:** Mitigated; the durable fix is task **T23** (still open).
- **Evidence:** HIVE-PLAN Round 1 finding F6, Round 2, T23 row;
  `HANDOFF-TBR.md` §6; `docs/BONSAI-RUNTIME.md` (T23 workaround note).
- **Status:** resolved operationally; real fix pending.
- **What it rules out:** importing the sibling at current `main` without the pin.
- **Cost to revisit:** low–medium (T23 shim: `conftest.py`, `harness/app.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_repo_layout.py`).
- **Worth re-assessing?** Yes — T23.

## F12 — Two ROCm contexts hang GPU1 at firmware level

- **Category:** (c)/(d) resolved incident + standing risk.
- **Claim/hypothesis:** Two independent ROCm processes can run on the two cards
  concurrently.
- **Method:** Ran a concurrent scorer + block-trainer (then a batch-4 scoring
  relaunch) with independent contexts.
- **Outcome:** The system went down twice; forensics show GPU1 (`07:00.0`) SMU
  metrics failing, then PSP/TOC firmware init failure (`error -22`) on the next
  boot, recovered only after a second reboot. Not host OOM.
- **Verdict:** Resolved by policy: **one heavy ROCm process at a time**; two
  cards are used only via a single model-parallel process. All GPU work pinned
  to GPU1 (`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`; HIP index = PCI order).
- **Evidence:** HIVE-PLAN Round 13 (crash forensics, second crash);
  `HANDOFF-TBR.md` §6.
- **Status:** resolved (policy), root cause external to this repo.
- **What it rules out:** independent concurrent ROCm contexts on this driver
  stack.
- **Cost to revisit:** none unless the driver/firmware stack changes.
- **Worth re-assessing?** Only on a driver/ROCm upgrade.

## F13 — `oracle.decode_q2_0_g64` decodes garbage

- **Category:** (d) open bug/risk.
- **Claim/hypothesis:** The type-42 `Q2_0_g64` decoder in `oracle.py` reads
  mainline 18-byte g64 blocks correctly.
- **Method:** Cross-checked decoded 1.7B `Q2_0_g64` tensors against the F16
  dequant / RTN agreement.
- **Outcome:** The decoder returns garbage. T7's reported 1.7B mean agreement
  of **0.612** came from the F16-dequant path, not from this decoder. The
  `PQ2_0` (type 142) decoder *is* byte-exact against Prism's own F16 dequant.
- **Verdict:** Open latent bug. Not on the 27B path (the 27B uses `PQ2_0`).
- **Evidence:** `experiments/ternary/oracle.py:190` (`decode_q2_0_g64` reads `d`
  from bytes 16..17 and `qs` from 0..15); mainline ggml defines
  `block_q2_0 { ggml_half d; uint8_t qs[QK2_0/4]; }`, i.e. `d` first
  (`~/.unsloth/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-common.h:194–199`). The offline test
  (`tests/ternary/test_oracle.py:35`) encodes the same wrong layout, so it is
  self-consistent but not a real validation.
  `RESEARCH/gate3-qat-verdict.md` (lines 29–30, 82); `HANDOFF-TBR.md` §7;
  HIVE-PLAN Round 12.
- **Status:** open.
- **What it rules out:** trusting `Q2_0_g64` agreement numbers from `oracle.py`
  until fixed; using this decoder for the 1.7B oracle comparisons.
- **Cost to revisit:** low (a few lines + one regression test in
  `tests/ternary/test_oracle.py`).
- **Worth re-assessing?** Yes — cheap correctness fix.

## Seeded-entry verification notes

All seeded entries F1–F13 were checked against their sources before writing.
Results:

- **F5 — contradiction found, then resolved by owner clarification.** The seed
  says "quality gate failed", but HIVE-PLAN Round 9 ("T28 COMPLETE — quality
  gate PASSED") and the T28 task row ("gate passed, best 1.103×") both record
  the opposite. Owner clarification: "failed" meant the **mission acceptance
  rate** (we expected to match Prism's retention and chased the last 8%), not
  the T28 1.44× gate. Both readings are correct against their respective bars.
  Recorded in the F5 entry as `[rev 2026-09-20]` and `[rev 2026-09-20b]`; the
  entry is now framed as a *deliberate scope stop*, not a methodological
  dead-end. This is the only seeded entry whose stated verdict did not survive
  verification unchanged.
- **F1 — artifact nuance (not a contradiction).** The 2.106× fixed-passage
  reproduction is attested in commit `ea089e2` and HIVE-PLAN Round 6. The
  persisted `artifacts/ternary/reference/*.json` files are the *held-out*
  (real-calibration) runs and show the collapse (1178× / 9184× / 34877×); the
  fixed-passage run was not persisted under a matching filename. Both facts
  agree with the reports.
- **F9 — RAM figures.** The seed's "~20 GB RAM" matches the host's *available*
  RAM (~19 GiB of 30 GiB) and the 14 GB per-job cap used for GPU jobs;
  HIVE-PLAN §1 lists the raw total as "30 GB RAM (+30 swap)". Not a
  contradiction, but note the distinction between total and usable RAM.
- **F2/F3** are recorded as "T32/Gate 3" in the seed; T32 was a diagnostics-only
  round with no source commit — evidence is the `artifacts/ternary/gate3/`
  reports plus the `RESEARCH/gate3-qat-verdict.md` write-up and HIVE-PLAN R12.
- **F6/F7/F8** PPL figures were verified directly from the saved eval logs and
  JSONs (1,252,835 / 1,055,018 / 172.28 vs 115.91).
- **F10** was verified against the actual server log
  (`logs/llama_server_8090.log`), not just the write-up.
- **F11/F12/F13** are recorded from HIVE-PLAN / `HANDOFF-TBR.md`; F13 was
  additionally confirmed against the `oracle.py` source.

No other contradictions were found between the seeded entries and the reports.
